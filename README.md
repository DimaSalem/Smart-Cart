### Smart Cart
Smart Cart is a console-based application designed to simulate a shopping experience with three sections: Food, Clothing, and Electronics. Users can navigate between these sections, adding items to their shopping cart as they go. The application keeps track of the items in the cart and calculates the total price dynamically. Users can continue shopping and modifying their cart until they decide to proceed to checkout.
